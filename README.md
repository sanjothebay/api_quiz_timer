This is my Forth homework assignment given to us by Technology de Monterrey Mexico Coding.To Create an question game application that
asked the user question with a timer countdown. 

**** I pulled the work from the Tech Monterrey Gitlab and I then created my own repository for the project

I started off by creating the questions and asnwers in a object. this qustion will start once the start button is pressed.
The question were practically given on the instructions. Once that was completed i moved to Creating the variables that contained the possible array of elements.

I then created my event listeners to when being clicked o the fuction will start. 
The function created was when click on the start button teh game wil start.

I Then created the if and else statements. if the ueser pick teh wrong number the app would show Right or Wrong. 
I notice that the app could not show the Right message when selecting the correct answer. This is due to the game will go to the next qustion if teh answer is correct and it does this very ast. There has to be a setTimeOut to control the function.

I created a page to take you to the Highscore page and input your initials (This would use the localStorage).The go back button take you back to the start of teh game.

I really tried my best im having a hard time with JS and i did not want to copy or cheat by grabing someone`s code. This is work done by me and all me. 
I have been staying up very late and asked lost of questions.looking over the classes again. Going to the after Hours. IM just a slow learner. I have no expernce in coding and i have gotten very for from what i use too know. Overall the app game does work. Im happy and very disapinted as im having a hard time. 
i will not give up. I know im the dumbest one in the class but i will get there. I wanted to put some color in the backgroung and or pictures but i felt disapointed.
